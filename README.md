# CLI
Made for me, by me.
***Express your creativity, only in the terminal.***

## General setup.
- Using Pip, install as **package**.
   - `py -m pip install cli_detroix23` (W.I.P.)
   - Dowload the TAR.GZ archive in the `dist` folder, and then `py -m pip install /path/to/archive`.
- Install as a **standalone project**, to test features.
   1. Download the ZIP archive (*Code* button).
   2. Go into the the freshly unzipped directory.
   3. Create a **virtual environement** using `py -m venv ./.venv`.
   4. Source into it.
       - Windows: `./.venv/Scripts/activate`.
       - Linux: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`.
   5. Run the main using `py ./cli_detroix23/src/`

## Windows.
_(because, obviously)_ 
In most cases, VT100 and ANSI color and escape characters will not be enabled in your terminal. To activate them, run: 
	`./windows/enableVT100.reg`.
