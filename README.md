# CLI
Made for me, by me.
***Express your creativity, only in the terminal.***

## Setup
1. Using Pip, install as package.
   - `py -m pip install cli_detroix23` (W.I.P.)
   - Dowload the TAR.GZ archive in the `dist` folder, and then `py -m pip install /path/to/archive`.
2. Install as a standalone project, to test features.
   - Download the ZIP archive (*code* button).
   - Go into the the freshly unzipped directory.
   - Create a **virtual environement** using `py -m venv ./.venv`.
   - Source into it.
       - Windows: `./.venv/Scripts/activate`.
       - Linux: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`.
   - Run the main using `py ./cli_detroix23/src/`
